## 📁 Project Highlights

### 📊 EV Insurance Pricing Prediction - Enhancing Risk Identification and Customer Retention
*Improved customer retention by 12% for an electric vehicle insurer by developing a pricing risk prediction model using Python, SQL, and ML algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, DNN).*

- Conducted extensive data preprocessing on over 1 million records, establishing abnormal and missing data handling based on business logic  
- Performed meta-data analysis on 57 anonymous driver features, applying resampling methods (Borderline-SMOTE/SMOTE-ENN) to handle severe data imbalance and reconstruct underlying patterns  
- Executed feature engineering by interacting, merging, enhancing, and selecting elite features, reducing dimensionality from 57 to 30, saving high-dimensional research and maintenance costs  
- Developed and iteratively optimized a XGBoost classifier, achieving a normalized Gini of 0.291 and AUC-ROC of 0.73  
- Increased high-risk user identification accuracy by 7% through targeted preprocessing and resampling  
- Generated comprehensive data reports and visualizations using PowerBI to communicate insights and support data-driven premium decisions

### 📈 Shanghai COVID-19 Forecast
*Performed causal analysis and multivariate forecasting on COVID-19 case trends.*

- Leveraged web-scraper to extract and receive daily updates from JHU CSSE and Shanghai Healthcare Commission  
- Conducted data validation, processing, transformation, and integration using Python for data mining  
- Performed causal analysis on infection rate, fatality rate, and outbreak time-points with self-made visualization dashboard  
- Developed and evaluated univariate & multivariate forecasting models (Best: LightGBM) based on 4 robust metrics  
- Conducted data-driven analysis for policy impact and outbreak trend visualization

### 📊 RFM & K-Means Customer Segmentation
*Initiated a customer segmentation project for a Shopify e-commerce platform using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis combined with K-Means clustering.*

- Leveraged Python and SQL to perform robust data analysis, processing, and RFM evaluation for customer engagement and value  
- Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers into actionable groups based on RFM scores, optimizing marketing strategies  
- Generated detailed RFM summaries and visualizations, identifying segments such as 'VIP', 'Frequent Shoppers', and 'At Risk'  
- Presented findings and actionable recommendations via PowerBI, enhancing e-commerce strategies and increasing repeat purchase rate from 31% to 42%
